# Welcome! ðŸŽ‰

If you're reading this then you probably want to know how the LAN Manager works or even contribute yourself!

Great!

To get yourself up and running run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/TheNerdMan/LANManager.git
cd LANManager/dev
npm run dev
```

This should run both the API and the UI client on your machine. There are some defaults in `/server/appsettings.json` for which servers the LAN Manager will listen for and send you alerts if you're an admin.

This is a super WIP project and I can't wait to remove this line!
